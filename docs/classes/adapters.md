###  simpleInterestLoan

**‚óè  simpleInterestLoan**:  *`SimpleInterestLoanAdapter`*




An instance of the simple interest loan adapter, which encapsulates the logic governing a simple interest loan.

Simple interest can be calculated as follows:

Simple Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Term of the loan

To make this more concrete, a creditor could issue a loan of 10 ether (the principal) over a period of 2 years (the term) at a rate of 10% (the interest rate).

By plugging these values into the above equation we're able to calculate the simple interest on this loan as follows:

10 ether _2 years_ 10% = 2 ether
